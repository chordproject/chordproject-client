# HomenaJesus

HomenaJesus.com is a digital songbook of Christian music. Created to support music ministries in the preparation of the Holy Mass and other liturgical times. It is also an ideal tool to animate these celebrations live. Unlike a printed songbook, this platform is dynamic. It adapts, evolves, grows, just like life itself.

## Overview

This application is designed for managing **songs** (with **chords**) and **songbooks**.

## Features

- Parses and formats marked-up music (lyrics and chords) using [ChordPro](https://chordpro.org) notation.
- Allows you to read, edit, or print songs with chord diagrams.
- Ensures chords are always correctly positioned, regardless of font or screen size.
- Stores songs online, with updates reflected instantly across all devices.
- Includes a viewer with tools for live performances, such as autoscroll, font size adjustment, **transposition**, and more.
- Enables organizing songs into customizable **songbooks**.

## Platform Description

We moderate **HomenaJesus** to be a Christian music platform. If you would also like to use it for other genres, we created **ChordProject.com** for you.
